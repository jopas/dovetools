# DoveTools v1.0

Visual theming, easier tag analysis and Otter transcripts for Dovetail

Version 1.0.2, September 2021

### Overview

DoveTools is a collection of tools to complement [Dovetail](https://dovetailapp.com/), the qualitative research platform. Please read the [introductory blog post](https://www.jussipasanen.com/dovetools-visual-theming-tag-analysis-otter-transcripts-for-dovetail) and watch the [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/Op44Kp8jBOw).

There are currently **three main tools:**

1. Export abbreviated highlights to Miro via Excel, for visual theming and affinity diagramming
2. Analyse tag relationships and see other common tags against the most frequent tags
3. Otter-to-VTT converter that allows importing Otter.ai transcripts into Dovetail

### Instructions
